# Vue 3 + Vite + Typescript

## Vite Example Music

A practical application created together with professor Luiz Ramirez, from his respective Vue course.
It's my second time redoing this project, to solidify the concepts that were taught.

In this project I developed a conceptual application that manages music, which utilizes a few of several utilities:

- Howler — js audio library used to play the music
- Tailwind — now I'm used to it
- Firebase — backend & user authentatication
- Vee-Validate — one of the best form validation for Vue
- Internationalization with i18n 
- Vitest — unit testing: makes the app bug-proof

...and others

The valuable concepts I learned here:

- Infinite Scrolling
- Upload a file by drag & drop using Vue event handler
